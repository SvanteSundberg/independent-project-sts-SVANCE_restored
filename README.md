# Sporta application developed by SVANCE 

## The users

**The system addresses the need of wanting to do sports and other physical activities but not having other people to do them with.** 
It addresses social needs for people to meet other people and exercise needs.

The end users of the system are students in general but students at Uppsala University in particular; this could be expanded to other universities in the future. 
Many students move away from home for their studies and might not have a big social circle in their new city. In Uppsala, student activities related to sports are rather popular; there are student sports teams and the nations arrange different sport activities. This suggests that there is a need among students to do sports. 
From personal experience we believe this applies to students with both big and small social circles; for example some friends that want to play soccer but need more people to form proper teams. Another aspect of the system is the physical and psychological benefits experienced from exercise. Many students experience a lot of stress, which can be relieved by physical activity. Because of this the system also addresses well-being.

## The application

The goal of the system is to connect students that want to do sports and have fun together. This will be realized through a mobile application. The app will allow students to register as users and create events that will be posted on a timeline, this timeline can be viewed by all other users. React Native will be used together with Expo for the front-end and Firebase will be used for the back-end.
